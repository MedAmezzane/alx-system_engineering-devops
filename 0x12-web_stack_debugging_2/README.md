# 0x12. Web stack debugging #2

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about permissions (owner, group and other) of files and directories in **Shell**.
This represented the third installment in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these assignments, I was provided with dysfunctional web stacks confined within isolated containers and tasked with restoring them to a functional state. For each task, I authored a script to automate the necessary commands for resolving issues within the web stack.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
