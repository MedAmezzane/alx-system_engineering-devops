# 0x0E. Web stack debugging #1

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. It aims to learn about how to debug a webstack.

This was the second in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers, and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the web stack.

## Technologies
