# Webstack monitoring

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**.
This project entailed the configuration of Datagog accounts to monitor server traffic across my three HBnB servers.

### Mandatory tasks

* **0. Sign up for Datadog and install datadog-agent**
  * The task involves signing up for a Datadog account, installing the Datadog agent on the server web-01, creating and applying an application key, and verifying the server's visibility in Datadog under the hostname "XX-web-01." The goal is to set up monitoring for server metrics using Datadog.

* **1. Monitor some metrics**
  * The task is to set up monitors in the Datadog dashboard for system metrics, specifically monitoring read and write requests per second. This allows for tracking and receiving alerts regarding these critical system metrics, aiding in scaling decisions for the company.

* **2. Create a dashboard**
  * [2-setup_datadog](./2-setup_datadog): Contain the dashboard_id, and it is likely obtained after creating a Datadog dashboard with a minimum of 4 widgets that display various visualizations.
