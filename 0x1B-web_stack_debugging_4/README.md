# Web stack debugging #4

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**.
This marked the fifth installment in a series of web stack debugging projects. In each of these projects, I was presented with broken or buggy web stacks within isolated containers and charged with restoring them to a functional state. For every task, I crafted a script to automate the commands required to rectify the issues with the web stack.

## Tasks

### Mandatory tasks

* **0. Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher**
  * [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp): Puppet manifest
  that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can effectively handle.

### Advanced tasks

* **1. User limit**
  * [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp): Puppet manifest that changes the operating system
  configuration so that it is possible to login with the user `holberton` and open a file
  without error.
