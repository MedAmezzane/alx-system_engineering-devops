# 0x0F-Load balancer

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. The aim of this project is to enhance the web stack by introducing redundancy for web servers.

In this project, I extended the configuration of the web server introduced in Project 0x0B. I received two additional serversâ€”one to replicate the Nginx configuration of the original server and another to establish an HAproxy load balancer, managing both web servers
